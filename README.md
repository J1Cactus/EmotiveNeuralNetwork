## Data
The IEMOCAP (Interactive emotional dyadic motion capture) database dataset can be downloaded from [IEMOCAP webpage link](https://sail.usc.edu/iemocap/). 
Since emotions are expressed through a combination of verbal and non-verbal channels, a joint analysis of speech and gestures is required to understand
expressive human communication. To facilitate such investigations, this paper describes a new corpus named the \interactive emotional dyadic motion capture
database" (IEMOCAP), collected by the Speech Analysis and Interpretation Laboratory (SAIL) at the University of Southern California (USC). This database
was recorded from ten actors in dyadic sessions with markers on the face, head, and hands, which provide detailed information about their facial expression and
hand movements during scripted and spontaneous spoken communication scenarios. The actors performed selected emotional scripts and also improvised hypothetical
scenarios designed to elicit specific types of emotions (happiness, anger, sadness, frustration and neutral state). The corpus contains approximately twelve hours
of data. The detailed motion capture information, the interactive setting to elicit authentic emotions, and the size of the database make this corpus a valuable addition
to the existing databases in the community for the study and modeling of multimodal and expressive human communication.
